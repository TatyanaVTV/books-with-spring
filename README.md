# BooksService

This project created in learning purposes.

*BookService* stores lists of Books and Authors and provides some UI (based on Thymeleaf templates) to access that lists.

Data are stored in *PostgreSQL* and accessed via *Spring Data* and *Spring Web*.
I've used *Lombok* to simplify and remove boilerplate code.
There is *Logback* for logging purposes.

## List of used technologies:
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data
- Thymeleaf
- PostgreSQL
- Lombok
- Logback

I also used external CSS-example to make navigation part for project's web-pages.
